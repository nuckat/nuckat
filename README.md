"From the ashes I rise a-new,
Pursuing change to make me true." - a new me

## About Me 
Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler. Iâ€™m currently fighting leukemia and over 600 days sober.

Iâ€™m an aspiring C++ developer working toward mastering the language. I dual-boot Linux and Windows, and Iâ€™m especially passionate about open-source software, privacy, and building tools that simplify life. These days, I keep to myself moreâ€”but Iâ€™m always working on something, whether itâ€™s a custom overlay, a personal utility, or a new keyboard design. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, music, and the occasional dive into writing poetry.

## ðŸ›  Interests
- C++ development (targeting modern standards like C++20)
- Linux (daily driver / dual-boot)
- Gaming & game utility programming
- Privacy-first tools and security
- Minimalism & system efficiency
- Amateur Music & Poetry Writing

## ðŸš§ Notable Projects
- [**tyOverlay**](https://github.com/nuckat/tyOverlay) â€” Lightweight, real-time C++ overlay for gaming macros and system feedback. (In early development)
- [**auto-luks-mounter**](https://github.com/nuckat/auto-luks-mounter) â€” A simple bash script for automatically mounting encrypted LUKS drives on Linux. 
- *More projects & Linux Bash Scripts coming soon...*

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy
I believe in building tools that respect the user, reduce clutter, and offer real utility. Simplicity, transparency, and function over hype.
I am a privacy advocate, or just plain "paranoid."
